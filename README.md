# Overview

This project is a Pokémon-inspired Pomodoro app that blends productivity with gamification. Users will complete Pomodoro sessions to earn XP, level up their Pokémon, and unlock various in-game features such as currency, random encounters, and evolution enhancements.

# Summary of Ideas

## Core Pomodoro Mechanics & Pokémon Theme
- **Pomodoro Timer:**  
  - Implements the classic 25-minute work / 5-minute break cycle or custom cycle.
- **Pokémon Starter:**  
  - Users choose a starter Pokémon (e.g., Generation I options like Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle) to represent their journey.

## Gamification Elements
- **XP System:**  
  - Earn 1 XP per minute of focused work.
  - XP accumulates and scales for level-ups and evolution (mirroring classic Pokémon progression, e.g., evolving around level 16, with increasing XP requirements).
- **Evolution & Upgrades:**  
  - Pokémon evolves as it gains XP.
  - For final-stage evolutions, introduce a "power-up" or cosmetic upgrade system (similar to Mega Evolutions or stat boosts).

## In-Game Currency & Random Encounters
- **Currency:**  
  - Earned by completing sessions and achieving milestones.
  - Can be used to purchase items like Pokéballs.
- **Random Encounters:**  
  - Use items to trigger random Pokémon encounters.
  - Catch probabilities may vary based on user level or item modifiers.

## Core Pomodoro Features with a Thematic Twist
- **Activity Categorization:**  
  - Label sessions with themed categories (e.g., "Gym Battles" for coding sessions, "Field Training" for creative work) using Pokémon-inspired icons.
- **Trainer Log (Session Comments):**  
  - Allow users to add notes to sessions, rebranded as entries in a "Trainer Log" or "Battle Diary."
- **Calendar Integration:**  
  - Design a "Journey Map" calendar to track sessions, milestones, and Pokémon encounters visually.

## Future Expansion Ideas
- **Pokémon Collection:**  
  - Gradually unlock new Pokémon through achievements or encounters.
- **Battle System:**  
  - Prototype friendly battles between trainers or against in-app challenges as a secondary feature.

# MVP Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Functionality & Basic Pokémon Integration
- **Pomodoro Timer:**  
  - Develop a minimal, distraction-free Pomodoro timer with work and break cycles.
- **Fixed Pokémon Representation:**  
  - Integrate a single, defined Pokémon to visually represent XP gains and level progress.
- **Basic XP System:**  
  - Map 1 minute of work to 1 XP with a simple level-up progression.

## Phase 2: Enhancing Productivity Features
- **Activity Categorization:**  
  - Allow users to label sessions with themed categories (e.g., "Gym Battles" or "Field Training").
- **Trainer Log:**  
  - Enable session comments as a "Trainer Log" for users to record reflections.
- **Calendar View:**  
  - Create a simple "Journey Map" calendar to track session completions and milestones.

## Phase 3: Advanced Gamification & Collectibles
- **In-Game Currency & Shop:**  
  - Introduce a currency system that rewards users with coins from sessions, to be spent on items like Pokéballs.
- **Random Pokémon Encounters:**  
  - Implement a system for random encounters triggered by using items, with catch probabilities based on user level or modifiers.
- **Advanced XP & Evolution:**  
  - Refine the XP curve to increase difficulty progressively.
  - Add evolution animations and upgrade options for Pokémon.
- **Optional (Future): Battle Features:**  
  - Develop simple battle mechanics between friends or in-app challenges.

# Next Steps
- Finalize the MVP feature set.
- Design wireframes for key UI screens (Timer, Starter Selection, Dashboard, Inventory, etc.).
- Set up a new GitHub repository and start implementing Phase 1 features.
